## About me
Hello, I'm Jeonghun Lee, a Master's student in the Department of Mechanical and Aeronautical Systems Engineering at Cheongju University. My primary focus is on deep-learning based target detection/tracking algorithms and Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) systems. I am passionate about enhancing the autonomy of aerospace systems through the integration of deep learning and control theory.


## Research Interests
I am deeply interested in developing robust and intelligent systems that can operate reliably in dynamic and uncertain environments. My key areas of interest include:

- Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC): Designing advanced  control algorithms for UAVs systems.

- Deep Learning for Aerospace: Applying neural networks for sensor fusion, object detection, and autonomous navigation.

- State Estimation & Filtering: Exploring Particle filters and their variants for precise state estimation.
